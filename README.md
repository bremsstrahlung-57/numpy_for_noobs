# Introduction to NumPy

This Colab notebook provides an introduction to working with vectors and matrices using the NumPy library in Python. 

## Notebook Contents

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction to NumPy**
2. **Vectors**
    - Definition and representation of vectors.
    - Creating row and column vectors using NumPy arrays.
3. **Matrices**
    - Definition and representation of matrices.
    - Creating matrices using `np.matrix()` and `np.array()`.
    - Matrix attributes: shape, size.
4. **Modifying Matrices**
    - Using `np.insert()` to add elements or rows/columns.
    - Modifying matrix elements using indexing.
5. **Matrix Operations**
    - Creating matrices with `np.arange()` and `reshape()`.
    - Performing element-wise addition and subtraction.
    - Transposing matrices using `np.transpose()`.


## Getting Started

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the code cells sequentially to understand the concepts and see the output.
3. Experiment with the code by modifying values and observing the results.
